## Task
Andritz Coding Challenge

As part of our selection process, we have designed a challenge for the second round of assessments.
Enclosed is a PDF attachment outlining a flowchart of a bleaching process, complete with various input and output variables as csv files.
Your task is to develop an effective machine learning model to accurately __predict the specified target variable__.

Your submission should address the following key areas:

__1 Feature Analysis__: Identify and justify which input features are most crucial in predicting the target variable.  
__2 Model Development__: Train a machine learning model capable of predicting the target variable from the identified input features.  
__3 Result Presentation__: Graphically present your findings using appropriate methods such as plots, heat maps, etc.  
__4 Code Submission__: Include the complete code of your work, ensuring it is executable for our review.  
 
We eagerly anticipate your participation in this challenge and look forward to receiving your submission by __Tuesday, 19th December, before 1 PM__. Following your submission, we will arrange a Microsoft Teams meeting to discuss your findings in detail.
